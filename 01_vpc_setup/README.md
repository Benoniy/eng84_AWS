# Setting up a VPC with 2 subnets!  

## Step 1: VPC setup  

1. The first step is to create the vpc in the "Your VPC's" section

2. When making the VPC there are only two important options.  
    * `blue` - Make sure you choose a good name  
    * `red` - Your ipv4 CIDR must use 2 unique numbers followed by 2 zero's and then a /16  
    * We will use these numbers again later on so don't forget them
